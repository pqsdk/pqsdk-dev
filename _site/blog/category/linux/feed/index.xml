      <description>Switching from Ubuntu to Crunchbang</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been an Ubuntu user since late 2005, when the 5.10 release was the latest.  About 3 weeks ago, I upgraded to the 11.04 release.  Unfortunately, my Dell Latitude D430 which uses the Broadcom wireless card just stopped working.  There appears to be some solutions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.baibhav.com.np/article/6-computer-tips-a-tricks/25-broadcom-wireless-card-is-not-working-in-ubuntu-1104-solved.html">http://www.baibhav.com.np/article/6-computer-tips-a-tricks/25-broadcom-wireless-card-is-not-working-in-ubuntu-1104-solved.html</a></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><a href="http://computerandu.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/how-to-solve-no-wireless-networks-in-ubuntu-11-04/">http://computerandu.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/how-to-solve-no-wireless-networks-in-ubuntu-11-04/</a></p>
<p>But instead of continuing using Ubuntu, I decided to use lighter distro or rather a distro with a lighter window manager.  I narrowed to 2 possible choices: <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> and <a href="crunchbanglinux.org">Crunchbang</a>.  After backing up everything I need to keep, I tried both.  First with Lubuntu.  Lubuntu uses <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment</a>, whereas Crunchbang uses <a href="http://openbox.org/">Openbox window manager</a>.  Since Lubuntu is just a variant of Ubuntu, the problem with the Broadcom card not seeing the wireless networks is still there. <br />
</p>
<p>Then I tried Crunchbang and it turns out to be a great experience.  Here are some of the features that I love about Crunchbang:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The installation is comparable to that of Ubuntu and its variants.  What's cool is that there's a post-installation script called cb-welcome in the /usr/bin/ directory.  I decided to run it.  Consequently, Java, the LAMP stack, git, hg, svn, etc are all installed.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The computer/OS runs much faster than I ever experienced before with Ubuntu.  I have installed on both of my laptops: a Dell Latitude D430 that I mentioned earlier and a Dell Inspiron 600m.  They both run great.</p>
</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
