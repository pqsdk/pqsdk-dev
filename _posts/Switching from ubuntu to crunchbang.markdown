title: Switching from Ubuntu to Crunchbang
---

I have been an Ubuntu user since late 2005, when the 5.10 release was the latest.  About 3 weeks ago, I upgraded to the 11.04 release.  Unfortunately, my Dell Latitude D430 which uses the Broadcom wireless card just stopped working.  There appears to be some solutions:

But instead of continuing using Ubuntu, I decided to use lighter distro or rather a distro with a lighter window manager.  I narrowed to 2 possible choices: <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> and <a href="crunchbanglinux.org">Crunchbang</a>.  After backing up everything I need to keep, I tried both.  First with Lubuntu.  Lubuntu uses <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment</a>, whereas Crunchbang uses <a href="http://openbox.org/">Openbox window manager</a>.  Since Lubuntu is just a variant of Ubuntu, the problem with the Broadcom card not seeing the wireless networks is still there.   

Then I tried Crunchbang and it turns out to be a great experience.  Here are some of the features that I love about Crunchbang:

* The installation is comparable to that of Ubuntu and its variants.  What's cool is that there's a post-installation script called cb-welcome in the /usr/bin/ directory.  I decided to run it.  Consequently, Java, the LAMP stack, git, hg, svn, etc are all installed.  

* The computer/OS runs much faster than I ever experienced before with Ubuntu.  I have installed on both of my laptops: a Dell Latitude D430 that I mentioned earlier and a Dell Inspiron 600m.  They both run great.
